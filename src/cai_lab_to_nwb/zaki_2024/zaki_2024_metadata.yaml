  session_description:
    In memory-linking behavioural experiments, mice were exposed to the neutral context for 10 min to explore. 
    During aversive encoding, after a baseline period of 2 min, mice received three 2 s foot shocks of either amplitude 
    0.25 mA (low-shock) or 1.5 mA (high-shock), with an intershock interval of 1 min. 
    Then, 30 s after the final shock, the mice were removed and returned to the vivarium. 
    On the next 3 days, the mice were tested in the previously experienced aversive and neutral contexts, 
    as well as a completely novel context that they had not been exposed to previously, for 5 min each. 
    The features of the neutral and novel contexts were counter-balanced and were made up of different olfactory, 
    auditory, lighting and tactile cues. 
    The aversive context was always the same with distinct cues from the neutral and novel contexts. 
    In the low- versus high-shock experiments mice were tested in the aversive context first, 
    followed by testing in the neutral and novel context counter-balanced; 
    half of the mice received neutral recall and then novel-context exposure the next day, 
    and the other half received novel-context exposure and then neutral recall.

    Simultaneous calcium imaging with Miniscopes and EEG/EMG experiment during retrospective memory-linking behavioral paradigm, 
    to test whether ensemble co-reactivation is sleep-state specific

  lab: Cai

    - Zaki, Yosif
  surgery:
    Mice were anaesthetized with 1 to 2% isoflurane for surgical procedures and placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). 
    Eye ointment was applied to prevent desiccation, and the mice were kept on a heated pad to prevent hypothermia. 
    Surgery was performed using aseptic technique. After surgery, carprofen (5mg per kg) was administered every day for the following 3 days, 
    and ampicillin (20mg per kg) was administered every day for the next 7days. 
    For calcium imaging experiments, dexamethasone (0.2mg per kg) was also administered for the following 7days.
  virus:
    AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f was injected into dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus on the right hemisphere (AP, −2 mm; ML, +1.5 mm; DV, −1.2 mm)
